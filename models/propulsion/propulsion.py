class IPropulsion(ABC):
    """
    Interface that should be implemented by propulsion models.

    Using this class allows to delegate to the propulsion model the management of
    propulsion-related data when computing performances.

    The performance model calls :meth:`compute_flight_points` by providing one or
    several flight points. The method will feed these flight points with results
    of the model (e.g. thrust, SFC, ..).

    The performance model will then be able to call :meth:`get_consumed_mass` to
    know the mass consumption for each flight point.

    Note::

        If the propulsion model needs fields that are not among defined fields
        of the :class`FlightPoint class`, these fields can be made authorized by
        :class`FlightPoint class` by putting such command before defining the
        class::

            >>> # Simply adds the fields:
            >>> AddKeyAttributes(["ion_drive_power", "warp"])(FlightPoint)
            >>> # Adds the fields with associated default values:
            >>> AddKeyAttributes({"ion_drive_power":110., "warp":9.0})(FlightPoint)

    @abstractmethod
    def compute_flight_points(self, flight_points: Union[FlightPoint, pd.DataFrame]):
        """
        Computes Specific Fuel Consumption according to provided conditions.

        See :class:`FlightPoint` for available fields that may be used for computation.
        If a DataFrame instance is provided, it is expected that its columns match
        field names of FlightPoint (actually, the DataFrame instance should be
        generated from a list of FlightPoint instances).

        .. note:: **About thrust_is_regulated, thrust_rate and thrust**

            :code:`thrust_is_regulated` tells if a flight point should be computed using
            :code:`thrust_rate` (when False) or :code:`thrust` (when True) as input. This way,
            the method can be used in a vectorized mode, where each point can be set to respect
            a **thrust** order or a **thrust rate** order.

            - if :code:`thrust_is_regulated` is not defined, the considered input will be the
              defined one between :code:`thrust_rate` and :code:`thrust` (if both are provided,
              :code:`thrust_rate` will be used)

            - if :code:`thrust_is_regulated` is :code:`True` or :code:`False` (i.e., not a sequence),
              the considered input will be taken accordingly, and should of course be defined.

            - if there are several flight points, :code:`thrust_is_regulated` is a sequence or array,
              :code:`thrust_rate` and :code:`thrust` should be provided and have the same shape as
              :code:`thrust_is_regulated:code:`. The method will consider for each element which input
              will be used according to :code:`thrust_is_regulated`.
