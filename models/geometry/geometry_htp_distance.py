    Computes geometric characteristics of the (tube-wing) aircraft:
      - fuselage size is computed from payload requirements
      - wing dimensions are computed from global parameters (area, taper ratio...)
      - tail planes are dimensioned from HQ requirements

    The hypothesis done is a fixed tail-wing distance leading to fuselage variation (rear_length) when wing position
    changes. This results in a highly non-linear behaviour on the static margin derivative relative to wing position.
